<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Lets Play Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://mgonzalezjr7.github.io/Lets-Play/)

Often there are points in time when you are looking for a new game, either to play alone or with friends. This website introduces a quick and simple way to find games and boardgames for your best game night! The Lets Play website starts with a quick quiz that asks the following

Video Game:
* What do you feel like playing on?
* Now are we going solo or looking to play with your friend(s)
* What genre are you in the mood for today/tonight?

Board Game:
* Now are we going solo or looking to play with your friend(s)
* What are we in the mood for?

Once the quick quiz is finished, several game options will pop up. Hover over the game to see details about it including release date, price, rating, and player count.
